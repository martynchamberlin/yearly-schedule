# Yearly Schedule

The idea that this repo is trying to solve is deceptively simple on the surface. Let's say you have a yearly schedule that involves performing a unique activity every day of the year in a linear fashion. You want the user to be able to specify what day of the year is their start date. And - here's the kicker - you want to be able to accommodate the complications that accompany leap years. On leap years, you have activity X.1 for February 28 and activity X.2 for Februrary 29, and on all other years, you combine X.1 and X.2 on February 28.
